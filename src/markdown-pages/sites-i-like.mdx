## Introduction

I think the importance of the internet lies in its ability to send you down rabbitholes of knowledge. 

In that vein, here is an unordered list of other fun websites and what I like about them.

## News and Aggregators
 - [Quanta Magazine](https://quantamagazine.org)
   - A tech news site that assumes that you're able to grasp complex topics, but not that you already know everything about them. Quanta is more for deep tech and emerging research in tech fields rather than everyday tech updates.
 - [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com)
   - Where tech's best and brightest go to get news. I first fell in love with Hacker News when I happened to check the site and noticed two things. The first was the god-awful UI. It's weird that I'm a frontend engineer but I'm drawn to gross-looking sites like a moth to a flame. The second thing that I noticed was one of the "top stories" was [Richard Stallman's essays on the philosophy of GNU](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/essays-and-articles.html). Hacker News is as much a space for computer people to come together and show-and-tell old verdigris pieces of the internet as it is a forum to discuss breaking tech news.

## Rationalist

Rationalism can be a bit of a touchy subject and I certainly wouldn't label myself as one. 
However, I can't deny the thoughtfulness of many shelters of Rationalist thought on the internet. 
The average length of a post is much longer on these sites and I'm a sucker for long-form anything. 
Plus a lot of prolific Rationalist posters and thought leaders are drivers in AI and machine learning 
so it's fun to see these long articles that cover everything from stock market models/predictions 
to AI-generated poetry.

## Webcomics

I really like that the internet has given a home to comic artists so they can share the visual 
equivalent of one-liners.

 - [Three Word Phrase](threewordphrase.com)
