The internet, at its best, is a series of rabbitholes. 

Here are some of sites that have led me down the most fun rabbitholes.

## News and Aggregators
I haven't included every news site that I read here. But the general trend should be decently easy to pick out. I like text-based news that has little advertising. Simple UI leads to more room for facts and less ability for third-party interests to make their way into my news consumption.
 - [Quanta Magazine](https://quantamagazine.org)
 - [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com)
 - [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/)
 - [OCCRP](https://www.occrp.org/en)
 - [The Gradient](https://thegradient.pub)
 - [Quantum Country](https://quantum.country/qcvc)

## Text Sites
I am mostly a React developer who works on website frontends so I absolutely love a well-made pretty site. But I am also nothing if not a sucker for a great text-based site. Here are some of my favorite sites that all work really well with the [lynx browser](https://lynx.invisible-island.net/) or [elinks browser](http://elinks.or.cz/).
 - [Sijmen Mulder's Text-Only Sites](https://sjmulder.nl/en/textonly.html)

 - [Phrack](http://phrack.org)
 - [Text Files](http://www.textfiles.com/)
 - [tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org/)
 - [tilde.club](http://tilde.club/)
 - [tilde.town](http://tilde.town/)

## Books / Literature / Philosophy
It's important to read books that aren't just caffeine-fuelled warppers around code snippets.

## Music
I think it's important to get a federated view of the music world and I try to follow small blogs where possible. I used to be better about it, but these are still some of my favorites.

## Rationalist

Rationalism can be a bit of a touchy subject and I certainly wouldn't label myself as a "rationalist". 
However, I can't deny the thoughtfulness of posts on many Rationalist sites. 
The average length of a post is much longer and I'm a sucker for long-form anything. 
Plus a lot of prolific Rationalist posters and thought leaders are drivers in AI and machine learning 
so it's fun to see these long articles that cover everything from stock market models/predictions 
to AI-generated poetry. Understand that it's a cult and if you don't move into a commune you can learn a lot.
