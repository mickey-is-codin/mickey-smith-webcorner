# Introduction
I really like the internet. It's this beautiful free exchange of ideas. 
In my lifetime it's evolved quite a bit and my relationship with it has changed a lot. 
But at its core I believe the beauty of the internet lives in two things:
 1. The graph-based approach of idea layout between webpages
 2. The text-driven content that computers excel at delivering

So in order to be a better citizen of the web I want to see, 
here is an unordered list of places on the internet that I like and what I like about them.

## Rationalist

Rationalism can be a bit of a touchy subject and I certainly wouldn't label myself as one. 
However, I can't deny the thoughtfulness of many shelters of Rationalist thought on the internet. 
The average length of a post is much longer on these sites and I'm a sucker for long-form anything. 
Plus a lot of prolific Rationalist posters and thought leaders are drivers in AI and machine learning 
so it's fun to see these long articles that cover everything from stock market models/predictions 
to AI-generated poetry.

## Webcomics

I really like that the internet has given a home to comic artists so they can share the visual 
equivalent of one-liners.
