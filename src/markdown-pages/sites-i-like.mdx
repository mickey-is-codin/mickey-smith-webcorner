# Introduction
I really like the internet. I grew up using it and I might hate that this is true, but it's a part of who I am.
It's changed a ton since I started surfing the web (all your base is probably the first meme I remember). 


But at it's core, I still believe in what the internet has to offer and that's a free, easy exchange of information. 
The internet makes consuming random information really fun because you know someone put time into creating that content. 
As such I feel that any good node in the network should direct you to some fun other places. 
With that, here are way too many websites that I've found myself enjoying over the years.
