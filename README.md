# Mickey Smith Personal Site

I wanted to try my hand at GatsbyJS, so I decided to use it for my personal site. The main goals for the site were:
 - Ability to write pages and blog posts with Markdown
 - Showcase resume main points in easier-to-digest format
 - Create a list of sites I enjoy browsing (better internet citizenship)
 - Easy integration with git for CI/CD

Main technologies used:
 - TypeScript
 - GatsbyJS
 - AWS Amplify
